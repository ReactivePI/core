# Core library for Reactive PI

Reactive PI is a library based on akka and scala that allows developers to
use the various I/O ports on their raspberry PI from Scala.

If you're interested in using ReactivePI with Akka, checkout the actors
package. This package extends the core library with Akka support.

The core library can be used standalone in your application. You don't need
to use Akka if you don't want to.
